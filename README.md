READ-ME GENERATOR

## Description
This is my readme generator. It is a node.js command-inline application to help developers save time and not have to type up an entire readme file and instead just input your necessary information. My motivation behind building this project was simply to just help everyone save time including myself. I used all my basic knowledge of node so far to create this application as well as some Javascript to actually run the program behind the scenes. Its simple light weight and gets you finishing up your projects faster. Please feel free to use this code, add to it, and turn it into anything you want.
